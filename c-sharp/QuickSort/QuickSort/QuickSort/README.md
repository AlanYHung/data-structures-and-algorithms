# Challenge Summary
Quick Sort is a sorting algorithm that takes an unsorted List and chooses a pivot point.
It then partitions(sorts) the list into 2 parts where the values smaller than the pivot value are moved before it (left partition),
and the values bigger than the pivot value are moved after it (right partition).  It continues this process for each partition until the partitions becomes a single
element list.  Then it merges all the sorted smaller lists into a single sorted list once again.

## Challenge Description
Write a blog to teach others how to code quick sort

## Approach & Efficiency
Quick sort uses recursive function calls to break down the list of values in half all the way down to single value lists and merges and sorts them all the way back up to the original.
