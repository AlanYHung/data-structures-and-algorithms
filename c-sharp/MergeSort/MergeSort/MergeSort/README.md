# Challenge Summary
Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm that takes in an unsorted array of integers and splits it in half into two new arrays. It continues to do this recursively until the array has been split into multiple arrays holding only one integer per array. It then begins to pass the pieces into a helper method that starts merging them back together putting the smaller values to the left of a return array. It does this until all pieces have been merged back into the return array leaving a sorted array.

## Challenge Description
Write a blog to teach others how to code merge sort

## Approach & Efficiency
Merge sort uses recursive function calls to break down the list of values in half all the way down to single value lists and merges and sorts them all the way back up to the original.
