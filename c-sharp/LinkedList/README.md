# Code Challenge: Class 05: Linked List Implementation

## Author: Alan Hung

### Challenge Summary
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
  * Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  * Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
  * Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
    * "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

### Challenge Summary Part 2
* Create an append method as part of the LinkedList Class that adds new items to the end of the list.
* Create an insertBefore method that will search for a list item and insert a new Node before that list item
* Create an insertAfter method that will search for a list item and insert a new Node after that list item

### Challenge Description
Create a functioning Linked List with insert, display, and search functionality.

### Approach & Efficiency
* Create a Node Class with value and pointer.
* Create a Linked List class with head pointer and to instantiate an empty list.
* __insert__ create a new node and set pointer to the Head's next node, and reset Head to new Node.
  * Efficiency: O(1)
* __includes__ create a pointer to traverse the list until you find value or reach end of list
  * Efficiency: O(n)
* __toString__ create a pointer to traverse the list and pull out the value.  Then append to string. Return the string.
  * Efficiency: O(n)
