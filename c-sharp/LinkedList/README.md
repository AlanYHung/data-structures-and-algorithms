# Code Challenge: Class 05: Linked List Implementation

## Author: Alan Hung

### Challenge Summary
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
  * Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  * Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
  * Define a method called toString (or __str__ in Python) which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
    * "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

### Challenge Summary Part 2
* Create an Append method as part of the LinkedList Class that adds new items to the end of the list.
* Create an InsertBefore method that will search for a list item and insert a new Node before that list item
* Create an InsertAfter method that will search for a list item and insert a new Node after that list item
* Create a KthFromEnd method that will take an int k and return the node value that is k spaces away from the end
* Create a ZipList method that will take in 2 lists and merge them via alternating nodes from each list
* Create a Stack with the methods Push, Pop, peek, and IsEmpty
* Create a Queue with the methods Enqueue, Dequeue, peek, and IsEmpty

### Challenge Description
* Create a functioning Linked List with insert, display, and search functionality.
* Append method adds new items to the end of the list
* InsertBefore method inserts a new Node with inputed value before a user chosen value
* InsertAfter method inserts a new Node with inputed value after a user chosen value
* KthFromEnd method will tell you the node that is k positions away from the end of the list
* ZipList will take 2 linked lists and merge them together via alternating nodes
* Create Stack where Push adds node, Pop removes node, peek returns value of top node, and IsEmpty lets you know if Stack is empty
* Create Queue where Enqueue adds node, Dequeue removes node, peek returns value of top node, and IsEmpty lets you know if Queue is empty

### Approach & Efficiency
* Create a Node Class with value and pointer.
* Create a Linked List class with head pointer and to instantiate an empty list.
* __insert__ create a new node and set pointer to the Head's next node, and reset Head to new Node.
  * Efficiency: O(1)
* __includes__ create a pointer to traverse the list until you find value or reach end of list
  * Efficiency: O(n)
* __toString__ create a pointer to traverse the list and pull out the value.  Then append to string. Return the string.
  * Efficiency: O(n)
* __Append__ traverses to end of list and adds the new node to the end
  * Efficiency: O(n)
* __InsertBefore__ traverses to the Node before chosen value and inserts Node in
  * Efficiency: O(n)
* __InsertAfter__ traverses to the Node and inserts the Node after
  * Efficiency: O(n)
* __KthFromEnd__ takes the length of the linked list then traverses to length - k node and returns value
  * Efficiency: O(n)
* __ZipList__ takes two lists and merges them into 1 list via alternating nodes
  * Efficiency: O(n)
* Stack Push is an insert function, Pop removes top node and resets top to next node, peek returns top nodes's value, and IsEmpty checks if top is null
  * Efficiency: O(n) / all methods
* Queue Enqueue is an insert function, Dequeue removes front node and resets front to next node, peek returns front nodes's value, and IsEmpty checks if front is null
  * Efficiency: O(n) / all methods
